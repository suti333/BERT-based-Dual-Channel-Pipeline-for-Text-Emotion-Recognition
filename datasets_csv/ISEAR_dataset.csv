hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and á
could not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the á
work and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other á
projects more than this one."
4272,sadness,"One of my good friends had to migrate to America.  Our friendship á
had developed quite well and it was a pity as our friendship would á
fade."
4273,joy,"I remember my religious experience.  During  a gospel camp, a few á
friends of mine decided to believe in God.  The joy that I felt á
at that time was more than words can express.  I blessed them and á
praised God in my heart."
4274,fear,"My friend and I had offended our classmate unintenionally.  We á
wanted to apologize to her so we decided to visit her.  We knew that she á
was stubborn so we were frightened.  When we rang her door bell, á
our fear was at it's climax"
4275,anger,"My girlfriend disliked it when I played majong (a game of gambling).  á
I expressed my regrets and when I went to see her she neglected my á
existance.  I was very angry and left in displeasure."
4276,sadness,"When I said good-bye to my girlfriend.  I had spent two years on á
developing this relationship and it was unsuccessful, I felt very á
sad."
4277,joy,"I learnt from the newspaper that I had been accepted at the á
Chinese university of H.K.  It was 7 o'clock in the morning.  á
Later I told my family and relatives about it and had tea with á
them very joyfully."
4278,fear,"I was camping in an old broken hut which had no lights.  I had á
brought along a lamp which was not working very well.  The door á
made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were á
happening.  The most terrifying bit was that there were many á
wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of á
the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me.   The á
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."
4279,anger,"During a football match, the other team was rude and they hurt my á
team members and me.  The coach was prejudiced against us and á
punished us unreasonably.  Later we fought with each other and á
the match had to be cut short."
4280,sadness,"I heard of the death of a closefriend of mine.  I had gone camping        á
with him shortly before his death and the whole thing seemed very  á
sudden to me. "
4281,joy,"After a busy day I went back to my hostel.  I closed the door and á
had a drink, then I read my favourite book on the bed.  Suddenly á
I felt peace and joy."
4282,fear,"When I went home and there was nobody, I waited till 2 A.M and      á
still nobody.  I was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never á
happened before.  In addition my mother was very weak and I á
feared that she had met with an accident.  Therefore I was anxious  á
all night."
4283,anger,"Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had á
abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very á
angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse á
so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin."
4284,sadness,"I had a schoolmate who went to the hospital as her brain was á
bleeding.  She fell unconscious for three days and when I went á
to see her I saw the miserable state the family was in.  Moreover á
I could not do nothing for her.  I was very sad.  Finally, she á
died."
4285,joy,"I was appreciated by others, especially my family members and my á
friends."
4286,fear,"Whenever I am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street, á
sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only á
partly visible.  This emotion was very strong when as an 8 year   á
old child I saw something horrible.  "
4287,anger,"[ Whenever I put myself in other's shoes and try to make the á
person happy, comfort him or make friends and I am misunderstood á
and rejected, especially when this person is a family member or a friend.]"
4288,sadness,"There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of á
mine.  He only thought about his own interest and not about our á
friendship.  This behaviour hurt his friends.  Another incident á
is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons."
4289,joy,"When I received the letter informing that I had been accepted to á
be a Chinese university student, I was excited as I had longed á
for it."
4290,fear,"One day when I was a little boy, my friends asked me to play á
with them outside and to catch some boys.  However our parents á
did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very á
late and I feared being scolded by my parents."
4291,anger,"When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to á
another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and á
attitudes.  I was very angry."
4292,sadness,"About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate.  á
This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would á
say such things.  The reason she gave me was that we were not á
suited for each other."
4293,joy,"[ During a certain period, I felt successful and extremely satisfied.   á
When I found that any tasks or decisions that I had made were better  á
than expected.]"
4294,fear,I am scared when I stroll alone on the Chung Chi college campus. 
4295,anger,"One day, I discussed a very important question with A.  A á
suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and á
thought that he himself was right.  Moreover, he attacked  á
strongly, not my opinion but me personally."
4296,sadness,"When I learnt that I had failed an exam,  This not only influenced á
my emotions but also other important tasks, it also made my á
record imperfect."
4297,joy,"I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had á
been admitted to the university."
4298,fear,"During the first year in university I had bad results in both á
the terms, especially the first term.  I was afraid that  I would á
not be promoted to the next year and that the others would go á
ahead of me."
4299,anger,Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
4300,sadness,"A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within á
two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not á
bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried á
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two á
years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as á
cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in á
suffernig , even die instead of her."
4301,joy,"One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had á
been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the á
soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having á
lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to á
why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me á
before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would á
look very nice if we wore them together."
4302,fear,"The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I á
had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare  á
for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would  á
not be able to finish it."
4303,anger,"A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for á
the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and á
the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an á
hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then."
4304,sadness,"After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would á
have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and á
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would á
understand this as they had always done).  They did not á
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many á
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."
4305,joy,"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was á
during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while á
handing in our homework.  He invited me have a trip with him and á
we were together till 8 P.M."
4306,fear,"The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to á
school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I á
reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the á
fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would á
die."
4307,anger,"One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back á
in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and á
wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him á
but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very á
angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly á
and freely."
4308,sadness,"When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed á
with my brother.  My parents slept on the lower deck.  My father á
felt disgusted and beat me up.  I felt very sad as my father had á
never beaten me or scolded me before."
4309,joy,"I had gone camping with my old classmates and there was a storm.  á
We were in a flurry but at that time I felt the love and concern á
of my friends."
4310,fear,"I was on a trip to Phillipines during Summer and I was staying in á
a hotel.  The room I was staying in was very silent and had very á
dim lights.  The last night I felt frightened and lay awake - I á
could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes - I á
waited for dawn."
4311,anger,"I had a very good friend in secondary school.  The year after our á
graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off á
all my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we á
were ready to give the entire day to her.  However this friend á
disappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I á
didcovered thay she was busy, I did not call her anymore."
4312,sadness,"I am a Christian but I cannot find any meaning in life . It á
seems that I am deceiving myself but I cannot find the way out."

surprised and happy as the result was better than I had á
expected."
4314,fear,"When I was young I got lost on the street and the police found me á
after a day."
4315,anger,"My sister once stole my mother's money and made her very angry.  á
After this my mother would beat her up for unreasonable reasons.  á
One day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my á
mother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and á
even threatened her with a pair of scissors.  "
4316,sadness,"My academic result was poor and I had to repeat the second year.  á
I felt sad about the coming several years."
4317,joy,"I was admited to the Chinese university of Hong Kong.  The day á
the results were announced I looked in the newspaper and saw my á
candidature number."
4318,fear,"One year, when I went to a camp, I was chased by a dog.  I tried á
hard and finally managed to escape from it.  My torch suddenly á
went off and we talked about ghost stories and I thought that á
there were ghosts."
4319,anger,"When I was in F4 I played a basket-ball match against another á
school's team.  One of their team members kicked a team-mate of á
mine so I kicked him back and we had a fight with each other."

I tried my best."
4323,anger,"I had a date with my girlfriend, the time and place had not been á
fixed.  I asked her to phone me an hour later as it was midnight á

for her call, she did not call me that night."
4324,sadness,"When I found that my ability to do ordinary work was worse than á
my fellow mates."
4325,joy,"During my Summer vacations I planned a carnival for the community á
youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the á
organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this á
period we got to know and understood each other.  We á
discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting á
things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was á
bright, the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.  á
I felt extremely excited about it."
4326,fear,[ No response.]
4327,anger,"I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told á
others that I would take down the names of the people who á
misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.  á
Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others. á
 I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he á
picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious á
enough to be blamed."
4328,sadness, [ No response.]
4329,joy,"When high level results were declared, I found my candidature á
number.  I was very happy as I had not expected it.  As I had been  á
injured before the examination and I had performed poorly."

angry.  She fainted suddenly and I was very scared as I did not á
know what to do ."
4331,anger,"When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. á
It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I á
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to á
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always á
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I á
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil á
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a á
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with á
them."
4332,sadness,"I quarrelled with my younger sister because I had said something á
against her boyfriend.  Consequently she looked through me when á
she saw me as she thought that I was trying to separate them.  á
She had misunderstood me."
4333,joy,"After attending a song contest proposed by a band called ""Chyne"" á
we (6 of us) waited for the members of the band to greet us in á
front of the stage.  We went out after a few minutes as it was á
time to close the hall.  We had been waiting at the entrance hall á
for ten minutes when three of the band members came out.  They á
were very excited to see us, one of them was so excited that he á
had tears in his eyes.  We felt very warm and close to each á
other.  They took us back into the hall and we talked freely.  We á
were together for about an hour and during this time we felt á
that they were very sincere."
4334,fear,"At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my á
mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and á
that her husband should go and see her.  I could not believe this á
as my father and my mother had gone out together to buy lunch á
boxes.  However I immediately ran to the scene of the accident."
4335,anger,"The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I á
should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of  á
her prejudice and misunderstanding, started a  quarrel with my á
mother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately á
talked of my mother's wrong doings.  I was very angry because - á
one my grandmother was not being reasonable and two because it á
should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new á
house that day."
4336,sadness,"When I was in lower six class during the Summer I joined a á
research group of the Chinese university student union.  I knew á
a lot of CV students there.  A year later one of them was á
travelling in mainland China and he got T.B.  He died a few weeks á
after coming back to H.K.  We all got together for the funeral á
and when I looked at the body for the last time I felt extremely á
sad."

possibility of being accepted into the university, I felt very á
excited."

court.   However when I arrived at the university gym the clerk á
told me that the court was being used for lessons."
4340,sadness,"When I was ill and had to stay at the hospital for a period of á
time.  "
4341,joy,"I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone á
houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have á
much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen á
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on á
which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the á
short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the á
plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat á
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."
4342,fear,"After seeing a horror film - Omen.  I could not sleep at night  á
even though I closed my eyes.  The last scene of the film kept á
coming back to me, I seemed to hear the girls in the film á
shouting at the devil.  The devil did not have any expression on á
his face and I thought that he would choose me."
4343,anger,"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that á
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's á
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I á
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so á
he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is á
I was in a bad mood then)."
4344,sadness,"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good á
friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them á
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind á
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made á
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was á
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
4345,joy,"During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close   á
friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my á
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had á
been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the á
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was á
really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all á
day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the á
good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my á
studies. á
"
4346,fear,"A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes á
outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would á
question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and á
did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet á
him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very á
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble."
4347,anger,"We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the á
inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there á
was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating á
lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them á
and then left."

I shared his sadness."
4349,joy,"That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the á
higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very á
carefully and found that my results were much better than I á
had expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My á
diligence had paid and I was very happy."
4350,fear,"When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the á
antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very á
frightened."
4351,anger,"Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very á
uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him á
furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence á
because of traditional moral values.  "
4352,sadness,"My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it á
was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I á
getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not á
expect too much from going to the university."
4353,joy,"One night, my boyfriend expressed his love for me in the canteen in á
the presence of my friends by giving me a present."
4354,fear,"After listening to ghost stories with my classmates I had to back á
alone to the hostel at night.  I had to walk through a long and á
quiet road and I was scared of meeting a ghost."
4355,anger,"I came across a girl at the school bus-stop, I had seen her á
several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend á
had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I á
smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen á
me.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry."
4356,sadness,"My examination results were not satisfactory even though I had á
tried my best.  Then I started wondering about my abilities for á
the major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major á
subject if I were to change it."
4357,joy,"When two female classmates and I were having lunch, we chatted and  á
cracked jokes, I was very happy.  However, I felt that I may have  á
said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad  á
impression of me."
4358,fear,"I did not do well in one of the subjects last term.   I was á
afraid that I would fail.  My result was a grade D, though it was á
not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.  "
4359,anger,"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt á
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did á
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other á
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant á
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á
say anything but just watched me leave."
4360,sadness,"Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before á
the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I á
got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all      á
good I felt a little sad."
4361,joy,"When I received a letter from the university telling me that my á
application had been accepted."
4362,fear,"At primary school the teacher caught me cheating during a á
dictation."
4363,anger,Someone spread rumours about me.
4364,sadness,"One night my father suddenly suffered from a heart attack which á
lead to breathing difficulties."
4365,joy,"I had a picnic with old classmates, we chatted and played games."
4366,fear,"At night when I was alone at home (all the family members usually á
get together at that time) someone knocked vigorously on the á
door."
4367,anger,"When I saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess I guessed that á
someone else had used my daily necessities.  I felt that my  personal á
sanity had been affected."
4368,sadness,"During the Physics experiment session I did not understand the á
content of the experiment and did not know how to do it."
4369,joy,"It was the first time that I gave a birthday present to my friend. á
  She wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend.  The content of á
the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy.á
"
4370,fear,"It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I á
had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that á
I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld á
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period á
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice á
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable á
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright á
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my á
brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue á
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."
4371,anger,"The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often á
grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This á
made me angry."
4372,sadness,"When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then á
and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives á
and my tears made me sad."
4373,joy,"In August,1983, the long awaited ""big envelope"" (a document for á
C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had á
not been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag, á
knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly á
opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. á
 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
4374,fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was á
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very á
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of á
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to á
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results á
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a á
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
4375,anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost á
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower á
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not á
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
4376,sadness,"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about á
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  á
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
4377,joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
4378,fear,"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a á
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I á
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door."
4379,anger,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her á
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in á
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me á
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be á
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á
child to teach."
4380,sadness,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had á
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After á
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and á
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others á
would think that I had not prepared for it."
